Project 1: Statistical Analysis of COVID-19 Mortality Factors
In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted an in-depth statistical analysis to answer a critical question: "How does the intersection of sex and chronic conditions influence mortality rates in COVID-19 patients?" Leveraging a comprehensive dataset, we employed the chi-square statistical test to scrutinize the association between sex and various chronic conditions in individuals affected by COVID-19.

This project involved meticulous compilation of a dataset, categorizing individuals based on sex and the presence or absence of diverse chronic conditions. The objective was to determine if there exists a notable association between sex and the prevalence of specific chronic conditions in COVID-19-affected individuals. The findings not only revealed significant correlations but were also presented in a manner accessible to a diverse audience, catering to those with foundational statistical knowledge.

This study contributes valuable insights for crafting targeted health interventions and policies, enriching the broader understanding of COVID-19 risk factors and facilitating informed healthcare decisions.
